"""
PhotoCalendar is a Python utility to create custom weekly photo calendars.
This package provides a :class:`PhotoCalendar <photocalendar.PhotoCalendar>` class which represents the photo calendar (days, weeks, photos, backgrounds, holidays, ...) and creates the calendar in HTML format (which can be then converted to PDF).

The appearance of the calendar is defined by the used template.
One simple :ref:`template delphinus <label-section-template-delphinus>` is provided.
