# Examples of PhotoCalendar usage

## What is here
- `*.dat` files contains sample data for the examples (weekday and month names, holidays).
- [preprocessExample.py](preprocessExample.py) is an auxiliary script pro preparation of data for examples.
I creates simple sample images for titlepage, weeks and backgrounds and also creates directory structure and copies common files to already prepared directories.

## Actual examples

### example1
The example shows how to use arguments of PhotoCalendar class and/or command line parameters.

### custom-template
